# Discord Inviter
A simple plugin that invites players to your Discord server if they haven't done so yet\
It works by detecting the gamemode of the player and if it's spectator mode, it's presumed they haven't joined yet and the message is displayed.

You can safely reload the config by reloading this plugin with [PlugManX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/plugmanx.88135/).\
(I do not recommend using it for other plugins! Plugin reloaders like this can seriously mess up some plugins)
